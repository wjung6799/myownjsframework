            Self taught developer looking for an opportunity. 
            I am highly motivated and always eager to learn new things. I like solving math puzzles and trying out new 
            technologies. My most recent interest is cloud computing and front end frameworks like react. Believe it or not when I 
            was taking web programming class I always wished that dom could be more object oriented like Java and I was trying to make my own framework and 
            turns out the exact same thing was react. Of course I stopped at designing stage because developing it would have been really difficult.
